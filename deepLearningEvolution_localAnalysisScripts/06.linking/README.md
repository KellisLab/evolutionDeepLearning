# Enhancer Gene Linking

This directory contains scripts for linking enhancers to putative target genes using the 
EpiMap correlation based enhancer-gene linkages.

These links are available here:
https://personal.broadinstitute.org/cboix/epimap/links/pergroup/

You'll also need a chain to lift from hg19 coordinates to hg38, available here:
https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/liftOver/

This folder also uses DEGs from Jorstad et al, available in supplementary table 3 of science.ade9516. 
You'll see these referenced in the scripts.
